# Simple Number Analyzer

## Project Description

The **Simple Number Analyzer** is a console-based application that analyzes various properties of a user-inputted number. The program performs several checks to determine if the number is positive, negative, odd, even, an integer, or a prime number. It also calculates the factorial of non-negative integers and lists the factors of the number.

## Features

- **Odd or Even**:
  - Determines if the number is odd or even.

- **Positive or Negative**:
  - Checks if the number is positive or negative.

- **Factorial Calculation**:
  - Computes the factorial of the number if it is non-negative.

- **Factors**:
  - Lists all factors of the number.

- **Integer Check**:
  - Determines if the number is an integer.

- **Prime Check**:
  - Checks if the number is a prime number.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the code.

2. Compile the code using a Java compiler or IDE. For example:
   ```bash
   javac main.java
3.Run the compiled program:
```
  java main
```
